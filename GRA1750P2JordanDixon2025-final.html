				<h3>Instructions</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							In a big bowl, mix in your dry ingredients, which consist of 1-1/2 Cups Bisquick, 2 Tbsp Seasoned Salt, 1 Tsp Paprika, 1 Tsp Black Pepper & 1 Tsp Dry Mustard.
						</li>
						<li>
							Add 1 Cup Club Soda and whisk until smooth. It needs to have a low viscosity or else you'll have way too much batter on your fries.
						</li>
						<li>
							Dunk your fries into the batter and let them drain off before tossing them directly into the deep fryer.
						</li>
						<li>
							Deep fry @ 350°F for 4-5 minutes. I would recommend doing this in a pan of oil and sift out the batter that falls off to create less of a mess. We didn't do this.
						</li>
						<li>
							Drain a bit before taking out and toss directly into a bowl with ground sea salt & black peppercorn so that the exterior of the fries get seasoned generously.
						</li>
						<li>
							Place in a french fry serving dish or bowl and eat like the wonderful person that you are.
						</li>
